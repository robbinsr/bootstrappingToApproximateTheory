Statistical theory indicates that sample statistics are unbiased estimators of the population parameters they seek to represent. The R programming language provides a built function named rexp(). The purpose of rexp() is to generate values for the theoretical exponential distribution.

This example shows that the data generated by the R function rexp() indeed, over 40 draws performed 1000 times, does provide data that maps to statistical theory. Therefore, at least in the context shown here, the function rexp() acts as expected. Note that if rexp() acts as expected, rexp() can then be used for simulation experiments that use rexp's outputs.
